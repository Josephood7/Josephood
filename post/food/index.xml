      <description>&lt;p&gt;While the pensioner of Ghent and his eminence were exchanging very low&#xA;bows and a few words in voices still lower, a man of lofty stature, with a&#xA;large face and broad shoulders, presented himself, in order to enter&#xA;abreast with Guillaume Rym; one would have pronounced him a bull-dog by&#xA;the side of a fox. His felt doublet and leather jerkin made a spot on the&#xA;velvet and silk which surrounded him. Presuming that he was some groom who&#xA;had stolen in, the usher stopped him.&lt;/p&gt;</description>

      <description>&lt;p&gt;Poor Gringoire! the din of all the great double petards of the Saint-Jean,&#xA;the discharge of twenty arquebuses on supports, the detonation of that&#xA;famous serpentine of the Tower of Billy, which, during the siege of Paris,&#xA;on Sunday, the twenty-sixth of September, 1465, killed seven Burgundians&#xA;at one blow, the explosion of all the powder stored at the gate of the&#xA;Temple, would have rent his ears less rudely at that solemn and dramatic&#xA;moment, than these few words, which fell from the lips of the usher, “His&#xA;eminence, Monseigneur the Cardinal de Bourbon.”&lt;/p&gt;</description>
